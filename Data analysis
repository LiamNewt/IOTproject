Types of Data Generated 

Ultrasonic Sensor data: Measures distance between the sensor and the object. 

Distance 

Status of lid 

Servo motor data: Data related to operation of the lid. 

Angle 

Movement commands 

 

Storing data: 

We plan to use a pushing box to store and send it to a spreadsheet it will protect the data being sent. 

The Arduino Yun has a micro-SD card which can be used to store sensor data in a simple format. It can also save CSV files which will record distance measurements, timestamps and servo movements. 

Data management: 

Data management will all be done through spreadsheets.
